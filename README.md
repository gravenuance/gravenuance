- I work on design and marketing more than I code nowadays.
- I'm also working on a philosophy degree (focus on metaethics and metaphysics).
- I don't really have a passion for coding, unless it's for a project I care about.
- Hard sciences only give me pleasure when I can see their positive effects on the society surrounding them.
